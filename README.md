# Philosophers

The goal of this project is to simulate the Dining Philosophers problem, a classic synchronization problem in computer science. Students must create a program where several philosophers alternate between thinking and eating, while avoiding concurrency issues and deadlocks by using appropriate synchronization techniques to manage concurrent access to resources.
